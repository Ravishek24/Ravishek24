### 🚀 About Me

I build backend systems and AI-driven features for fintech products that need speed, reliability, and clean architecture.

- 🧠 Developing practical ML solutions using **Python**
- ⚙️ Building scalable APIs and real-time systems with **Node.js**, **MySQL**, **Redis**, and **WebSockets**
- ⚡ Exploring **Go** and **C++** for high-performance components
- ☁️ Deploying and scaling on **AWS**

I’m interested in financial markets, market data pipelines, and performance-focused system design — especially in early-stage startup environments.
